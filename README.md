# Youtube-History

Using Google's takeout, you can have all the records and data of anything Google related for your account. I decided to use this feature to look up my Youtube history and see anything noticeable with my history. 

The languages I'm using is Python and SQL with SQLite. The notable libraries I'm using is BeautifulSoup4, NLTK, datetime, and matplotlib.
